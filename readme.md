# WP Resume Builder Shortcode Usage

To display your resume on a WordPress page or post, use the following shortcode:

```
[wp_resume]
```

Simply insert this shortcode into the content area of any page or post where you want your resume to appear. The plugin will automatically replace this shortcode with the formatted resume content based on the information you've entered in the plugin settings.

## Example Usage

1. Edit a page or post in WordPress.
2. In the content editor, add the following:

   ```
   <h1>My Professional Resume</h1>

   [wp_resume]

   <p>Thank you for viewing my resume!</p>
   ```

3. Update or publish the page/post.

The `[wp_resume]` shortcode will be replaced with your full resume content when the page is viewed.

Remember to configure your resume details in the WP Resume Builder settings page in your WordPress admin area before using the shortcode.
